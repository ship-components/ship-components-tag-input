# ship-components-tag-input
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) select box. Exports a commonjs module that can be used with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). Source is in ES6 and is compiled down to ES5 using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ship-components-select.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ship-components-select)

## Usage

### ES6/JSX (Recommended)
The component is written using ES6/JSX therefore Babel is recommended to use it. The below example is based on using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader).
```js
import React from 'react';
import Select from 'ship-components-select';

export default class ExampleClass extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'One'
    };
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      value: event.target.value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className='form-group'>
        <Select onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)}
          defaultValue={this.state.value}
          options={['One', 'Two', 'Three']}
          />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Examples and Development
Examples can be found in the `examples/` folder. A development server can be run with:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

which will live reload any changes you make and serve them at http://localhost:8080.

### Webpack Configuration
This module is designed to be used with webpack but requires a few loaders if you are pulling the source into another project.

```shell
$ npm install webpack babel-loader css-loader style-loader postcss-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin postcss-nested postcss-color-hex-alpha postcss-color-function postcss-calc autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Below are is a sample of how to setup the loaders:

```js
/**
 * Relevant Webpack Configuration
 */
{
  [...]
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // Setup support for ES6
      {
        test: /\.(jsx?|es6)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel'
      },
      // Setup support for CSS Modules
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style-loader', 'css-loader?modules&importLoaders=1&localIdentName=[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]!postcss-loader')
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    // Extract the css and put it in one file. Path is relative to output path
    new ExtractTextPlugin('../css/[name].css', { allChunks: true })
  ],
  // CSS Modules
  postcss: [
    require('postcss-nested'),
    require('postcss-simple-vars'),
    require('postcss-color-hex-alpha'),
    require('postcss-color-function'),
    require('postcss-calc'),
    require('autoprefixer')
  ],
  [...]
}
```
